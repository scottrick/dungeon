Game Idea

A dungeon crawler tile based game.

The goal is to have the most valuable treasure at the end.  Not sure if we would want hex or square tiles.

Everybody has a hero (different race/class combos?) and they are all start at the beginning of the dungeon, on the same space.  The starting  tile has three different paths, and the players will take turns placing their tiles on available 

There are three different sets of dungeon tiles; a set for level 1, 2, and 3.  There would roughly ~5 tiles per player?  There are also three different "boss" tiles.

What happens on a players turn?  

1) they move their hero.  If the hero moves into an unexplored tile, they draw the next tile from the pile and place it.  The hero must stop here and can more no further.
2) based on what tile the hero ended on, they take an appropriate action.  

Tile Types
-----------------
Monster Tile:  
A monster tile is randomly chosen and placed on the tile.  Whenever a player moves their hero to a monster tile, all players present fight the monster.  Each monster has a "strength" number associated with it.  All have a strength number themselves, and roll the same number of dice as their strength roll.  Each roll of 3 or more is considered a 'hit'.  If the total number of hits is greater or equal to the monsters strength, the monster is defeated.  

Once the monster is defeated, draw and reveal one treasure for each player present when the monster was slain.  Begin with the player who's turn it was.  That player picks a treasure item.  Each other hero, may make an offer of any one(1) item they own.  They all keep their offer facedown until all the other heroes who are bidding have made their selection.  (silent bidding).  The starting player may either take the item they chose, or take any of the offers made to them.  If they take an offer, the player who made the offer gets the item.  Rotate clockwise to the next person who doesn't have an item yet and they pick the next item, and the remaining heroes can bid on whatever they pick, if they wish.  Each hero can only get one piece of treasure and can't bid after they got their item.  

Treasure Tile: 
The random treasure tile is placed facedown here.  If a player moves their hero to the treasure space, they get the treasure.  

Empty Tile:
If a hero ends their turn on an empty tile, nothing happens?  A monster tile that has been defeated or a treasure tile that has been searched is considered an empty tile.

Puzzle Tile:  ??????


Treasure
-------------- 
Weapons:  weapons provide a strength bonus to the hero.  A hero can only use one weapon at once.  Weapons also have a gold value which is added to your total at the end of the game?

Artifacts:  provide special abilities, or additional strength.  You can use as many artifacts as you want, except for duplicates?  Examples:  boots of speed (+1 movement), Midas touch (+1 gold whenever you get gold?),  cloak of invisibility (allows hero to travel past monsters), etc?

Gold: Item cards that are simply worth gold at the end of the game.
