************ Retro/Basic RPG Ideas ************
***********************************************


Goals
-----

1) Simple graphics, so I can make the art myself.
2) Relatively basic RPG gameplay and concepts.  I want to lean towards zelda rather than skyrim.  
3) Use JavaScript and the web to deliver the game.  This makes it way easier for anybody to play the game.


General Game Concept
--------------------

Create a simple top down RPG, with controls and graphics similar to SNES Zelda.

First goal would be to create a tile engine which can display the terrain and objects on the terrain.

Second goal would be to create a basic map editor of sorts, so I can create maps for the game easier.  

I think it would be fun to have the over world map be a set map between all play sessions and then have the dungeon levels be randomly generated maps.
