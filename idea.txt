************ Retro/Basic RPG Ideas ************

Goals
-----

1) Simple graphics, so I can make the art myself.
2) Relatively basic RPG gameplay and concepts.  I want to lean towards zelda rather than skyrim.  
3) Use JavaScript and the web to deliver the game.  This makes it way easier for anybody to play the game.
